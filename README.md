# GreenPassQrSharp

Just wanted to take a look at the QR i got after receiving the vaccine.

But i didn't want to install the tooling i usually don't work with (python)

And become allergic to javascript ðŸ’©.

Actually it dosn't validate the signature, that should be easy to implement but i was not intrested.
